Technique for Recommender System

Course Number: CS F469

Language: Python 3

This project is about implementing collaborative filtering for building a recommender system. 
It outputs the time taken for prediction, root mean square error, precision on top k and spearman rank 
correlation for this technique. 

The two implementations of a recommender system in this project are:-
1) Collaborative
2) Collaborative with baseline approach

Dependencies: numpy, re, heapq, timeit, 

Working:
1. Run CF.ipynb, CF_baseline.ipynb for collaborative filtering and 
 collaborative with baseline respectively.
2. After few minutes, the output will be displayed.
