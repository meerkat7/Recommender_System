We take care of bias of users by subtracting mean rating of each user from all of their ratings. This helps to reduce the mean rating of a high user and inc mean rating of strict user and hence normalizes the bias. 
This is done at the end of the "process" function in SVD and CUR and is done separately in Collab filtering.
